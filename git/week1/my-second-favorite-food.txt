What’s In Ikea’s Swedish Meatballs
Glazed in a lush creamy gravy sauce, these warmly spiced beef and pork Swedish meatballs are comfort food to the core. Ikea Swedish meatballs are served with boiled red potatoes or mashed potatoes, but my favorite way to eat them is lathered in sauce over thick pappardelle egg pasta noodles, making them the perfect easy dinner, or an easy appetizer when served on their own.
